# Heatmap generation using python

## Installing prerequisites

Prerequisites can be installed by running the following command:

    make configure

This command will install the requiements required to generate the heatmap and some development packages.


## Build the heatmap

The heat maps can be generated by running the following command:

    make build state=$(STATE)

Where `$STATE` is the name of the desired state for the heatmap. See [mappa/config.py](mappa/config.py) for the list of names available.

An special `all` keyword has been added to generate all the available states. e.g.

    make build state=all

These commands will place the generated PNG images at the root of the repository. See [heatmaps/](heatmaps/) for the provided generated graphics.


## Clean up generated heatmaps

This command can be used to clean up the PNG images generated at the root of the repository.

    make clean
